:chapter User Interface
    
    The architecture of loom does not only allow the creation of static images
    that are printed on paper, but also dynamic images that are drawn on a 
    computer screen .
    
    The interface between a computer program and a human can be on of them .
    
    User Interface as a graph
    
        
    Surface
      -> Browser Canvas
      -> PNG

    - Protocol based
    - UI runs as separate process or thread
This is an idea to create a program (or library if you prefer it) that provides reasonableâ„¢
looking interface.
For reference [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/52cnw5/designingbrainstorming_an_idiomatic_flexible_rust/)

Also the UI part would probably contain other languages.

### motivation:

* nonblocking UI with whatever programming model the developer prefers.
* separate users for program and UI (safe to use privileged programs under X11 or Wayland) 

### goals:

* works with message passing (separate processes, different CPUs, network)
* clean separation between program and UI (no shared mutable state)
* accessibility
* complete impl for the browser (can be used as server)

### non-goals

* custom widgets (if something useful is missing -> contribute)
* direct control over style by the program
